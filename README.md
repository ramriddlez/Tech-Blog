## Description

This is a blog style application, where users can sign up, log in and create posts in a CMS blog style format! Technologies used were:
mySQL for databse, Sequelize for database communication, Express for middleware and more middle ware techynologies such as WithAuth, adn HTTP routes. We utilized Handlebars.js for front end deployement and BOOTSTRAP for the styling. Furthermore, dotenv was used to protect mySQL data, along with bcrypt to encrpyt user passwords. This MVC paradigm blog style is a great example of the things we can build using new technologies!
